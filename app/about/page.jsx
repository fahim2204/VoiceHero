                            <p>Our mission is to make on-demand multilingual audio support a reality across education, streaming, audiobooks, gaming, movies, and even real-time conversation.</p>

                            <p>Our research powers the platform's current features but it also contributes to realizing our ultimate goal of instantly converting spoken audio between languages. The AI dubbing tool - aimed for release later this year - will let users automatically re-voice any audio or video in a different language, all while preserving the original speaker's voice.</p>

                            <p>ElevenLabs was founded in 2022 by best friends: Piotr, an ex-Google machine learning engineer, and Mati, an ex-Palantir deployment strategist. Inspired by the 'poor' dubbing of Hollywood movies they watched growing up in their native Poland, the pair set about designing a platform which could eliminate the linguistic barriers of content.</p>
